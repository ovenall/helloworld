Victoria Regina Tarot kit by Sarah Ovenall and Georg Patterson, art by Sarah Ovenall. Ovenall is a master collage artist and uses her Victorian source material to great effect. Knowledge of Victorian history is not necessary to use this deck, although of course an interest in the time period and appreciation for its style are essential. The Collages follow the Rider-Waite tradition.
